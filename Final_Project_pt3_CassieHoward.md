# Final Project Part III

## The Journey
This project started as a very vague idea which has gone through various steps to become a final story to help encourage the audience to buy an electric vehicle. The audience for this story started out as being anyone who was going to be buying a new car.  As the story developed through the stages it continued to narrow. The final story is intended for people who are concerned about helping the environment and air quality and who want to do something to help fix it.

Part I helped me flesh out the idea and organize my thoughts around what story I wanted to tell.  I used the exercise we practiced in class and created statements about what I wanted the ready to do.  I knew I wanted people to consider buying an electric vehicle.  I then worked on forming why they should want to do it.  This helped me form a key statement for the project.  I used this statement to start some research, develop and outline, create a Story Arc around how I wanted my readers to react, find some data to support my story and then draft some visuals.

As I continued with my research in Part II, I created a story board that helped me arrange which visualizations I wanted to use and the possible order I wanted to arrange them in.  I was able to obtain the data from various sources to help start to develop my visuals.  I found this to be the hard part.  I had great ideas on how I wanted my visuals to look and I had the data, but I found the data didn’t really match with that type of visual I was considering or I had issues getting visual tools to create that look of what I wanted.  For example, I had a plan to use a dollar bill to represent the cost in a more dynamic way, however, the values were all higher than a one dollar so the visual was not as impactful.  I also struggled to get that type of visual using the tools I have available, so I switched the visual.  

I drafted the visuals using the actual data and used PowerPoint to create a wireframe that put the visual with some context in the order I wanted to tell the story.  I then had three people review and provide feedback of the story so far.  I received a lot good feedback for everyone.

I thought about the feedback and the story that I wanted to tell, then decided what changes I needed to make.  I realized a few of my visuals were misleading.  For example, I had a map with a radius circle to show range however it led the reader to think that the driving range was anywhere within the circle and not the distance the center point of the circle.  I also added a new visualization relating to battery charging time.

Now it is time to start putting the story with the visuals.  I gathered all the references and research I had done in Part I and started drafting the story without using the visuals.  I decided to use the tool Shorthand to tell the story, so I started matching the visuals to the written story in Shorthand.  As I did this, I found that I had two visuals that were redundant, so I removed one.  I also re-evaluated the visual for battery power range and decided it wasn’t needed.  The order of the story changed a little, but the main sections of problem, solution, and conclusion from the storyboard remained the same.

# About Me
My name is Cassie Howard (She/Her) and I am starting my final year in the remote MSIT program at CMU.  I am currently a manager in the IT department at General Motors and have worked in various IT roles at GM for 19 years.  The MSIT remote program is allowing me to continue to invest in myself by learning new areas of IT and broadening my skills, all while continuing to work.   It is tough to balance between work, school, and homelife but I am enjoying the challenge.  

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn new techniques to present data more dynamically.  I work in a very data driven organization and part of my job is to analyze and present data that allows leaders to make decisions on future projects.  I would like to improve on visualizing the data in a more effective way so that decisions can be made faster and more efficiently.

Here is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class as CMU! 

# About Me
My name is Cassie Howard (she/her) and I am starting my final year in the remote MSIT program at CMU.  I am a manager in the IT organization at General Motors (GM) and have worked in various IT roles at GM for 19 years.  GM is a large corporation with a complex IT environment, which has allowed me to work on some very diverse projects.  I started my career right out of college working as an entry level operator/help desk agent at a single manufacturing plant in Detroit, MI.   I have grown through the organization by challenging myself to take on new work and assignments even when they are outside of my comfort zone.  I have worked on cutting edge projects like the Chevy Volt launch and not-so-cutting-edge projects like organizational restructuring.  I currently manage a team who is responsible for deploying new IT solutions, performing IT system upgrades, and remediating security vulnerabilities at over 75 manufacturing sites globally.

The MSIT remote program is allowing me to continue to invest in myself by learning new areas of IT and broadening my skills, all while continuing to work.  It is tough to balance between work, school, and homelife but I am enjoying it.  My goal after graduation is to continue toward obtaining a Director or Executive role within General Motors.

# What I hope to learn
Both IT and the automotive industry have changed very drastically in the last 5-8 years.  The amount of data that is being collected and used now vs 10 years ago is staggering and it is only growing.  I work in a very data driven organization and part of my job is to analyze and present data that allows Executives to make decisions on future projects.  I hope to learn new techniques to present data more dynamically and to improve on visualizing the data in a more effective way so that decisions can be made faster and more efficiently.

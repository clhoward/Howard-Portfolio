# Critque By Design

## Data Visualization to Critque

I chose to critque the data visualizations within the Generation section of the [National Overview: Facts and Figures on Materials, Wastes and Recycling](/https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture) article.  While my critque is focused on the Generation Tonnages, 1960-2017 visualization, I have also looked at the Total MSW Generated by Material, 2017 as part of the redesign process since the graphs are so closely related.

### My Critque Process
I started the critque process using the Good Charts method of documenting my very first impressions then going a little further indept to read the chart. The Good Charts method helped me determine which data visual I wanted to continue with.  Then I used the Stephen Few method for a more specific critique method.  This method helped my break down the actual things I liked and disliked into more detail in terms of why I didn't like something. The specific questions focused me to help determine what needed to change in the visualization.

My first impressions from the Good Charts Method were:
1. There are a lot of categories/colors in both charts. 
2. I can easily pick out the largest category as being "Paper & Paperboard" and it is easy to that that this category has always been the largest. 
3. It is also clear to see the overall amount of total tonnage generated has increased drastically since 1960. 

Then I used the Stephen Few method for more indepth analsys:
**Aethetics and Usefulness**

The largest catagory and total tonnage increase were the only 2 obvious points of the data.  With the large number of categorie and colors and the way the data is sorted, it is hard to determine the top 4 catagories to review or what the important catagories are. I kept having to go back and look at the legend or hover over the points to determine the catagories. The dots/points on the data are also distracting because there are so many of them on the chart. This lends to lower Aesthetics and usefulness scores.

**Usefulness, Truthfulness and Perceptibility**

When I read the information under the chart, the author was looking to convey points that the chart did not reflect. The author mentions that the Tonnage generation of "Paper & Paperboard" is trending down since 2005.  While I see a dip in 2005, the area change is barely perceptible and the dots in the line graph look like they trend up (not down) because the overall tonnage generation is going up. Other trends pointed out for Yard Trimmings and Plastics were not obvious in the visualization.  The dots/points make the visual look like a trend line which is more quantity based and not an area graph which is more proportion based. In addition, the scaling for Tons reduces the ability to see trends unless they are large differences.  The chart does not represent the points being made by the author. This led to lower usefulness, truthfulness and perceptibility scopes. 

**Intuitiveness**

When I read the entire article, I get the impression the author tried to stick with the same type of charts for consistency sake and not because it was the best representation of the data. The stacked area chart worked well earlier in the article when there were only 4 categories, but it didn't work well with 11 categories. So intuitiveness in reading a known chart type was average. 

**Intended Audiance**

The article indicates the primary audience is going to be municipalities doing research on where they need to focus or change their future recycling programs.  This would make the top generators of waste and trends of the top generators an important aspect of the data.  The audience could also include students or other people doing research wanting to learn more about National recycling statistics.  This article contains a lot of data and most of the points are data driven but the visuals do not help to highlight the important aspect of the data. 

**Recommendations**

I would change the order of the categories to arranged from largest to highest, simplify the chart by removing the dots/points, and highlight the colors of the chart to the few categories that the author is trying to convey. I would also change the scale of Tonnage to help show the trends that the author is trying to convey. The article mostly references data between 1990-2017, so I would start by removing 1960-1980. That would allow the resizing of the Tons access to show more detailed changes. If that isn't enough, maybe a different style chart should be considered. Most of the data is removing something or changing visualization, not adding more data. The data is there, but not put together in a way that helps drive the points made in the article.

I think the primary audience is going to be either municipalities doing research on where they need to focus their recycling programs or possibility students doing research on recycling. This article contains a lot of data and most of the points are data driven but the visuals do not help to highlight the important aspect of the data. I don't leave the article with any points that stick out in my head. I think it does well providing the data, but this particular visualization does not portray the data well and is not very compelling based on the information in the first question. 

I feel this method worked well for evaluating the visualization. I could tell the chart did not work well, but having to rank specific aspects of the chart helped me explain why it wasn't working. I also helped me think about what I would change. I initially found myself using a portion of the Good Charts method of making notes of the first things I saw and likes/dislikes right way. The Good Charts method is a little more general and simplified, which I found useful for a quick review. The Stephen Few method was much more specific then the Good Charts Critique Method. It helped my break down the actual things I liked and disliked into more detail in terms of why I didn't like something. The specific questions focused me to help determine what needed to change in the visualization . I do think that the Aesthetics measure in the Stephen Few method is a little too broad. The entire critique process is subjective, but the concept of Beauty is very subjective. People might perceive beautiful with complex or colorful, which could lead someone to use visuals that are hard to read. I think a useful question could be added around color. Example: Use of color: Do the colors (or lack of colors) used help visualize the story or distract from the story. Are there too few colors or to many colors? Colors are thoughtful 1 - 10 colors are distracting

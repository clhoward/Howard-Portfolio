# Critique By Design

## Data Visualization to Critique 

I chose to critique the data visualizations within the Generation section of the [National Overview: Facts and Figures on Materials, Wastes and Recycling](/https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture) article<sup>1</sup>.  While my critique is focused on the Generation Tonnages, 1960-2017 visualization, I have also looked at the Total MSW Generated by Material, 2017 as part of the redesign process since the visualizations are closely related and paired up in the article.

### My Critique Process
I started the critique process using the Good Charts method of documenting my very first impressions then going a little further in-depth to read the chart. The Good Charts method helped me determine which data visual I wanted to continue with.  Then I used the Stephen Few method for a more specific critique method.  This method helped my break down the actual things I liked and disliked into more detail in terms of why I didn't like something. The specific questions focused me to help determine what needed to change in the visualization.

My first impressions from the Good Charts Method were:
1. There are a lot of categories/colors in both charts making it difficult to read at first.
2. I can easily pick out the largest category as being "Paper & Paperboard" and it is easy to that that this category has always been the largest. 
3. It is also clear to see the overall amount of total tonnage generated has increased drastically since 1960.

Then I used the Stephen Few method for more in-depth analysis:

**Aesthetics and Usefulness**

The largest category and total tonnage increase were the only 2 obvious points of the data.  With the large number of categories and colors and the way the data is sorted, it is hard to determine the top 4 categories to review or what the important categories are. I kept having to go back and look at the legend or hover over the points to determine the categories. The dots/points on the data are also distracting and make the sections look like trendlines.  This lends to lower aesthetics and usefulness scores.

**Usefulness, Truthfulness and Perceptibility**

When I read the information under the chart, the author was looking to convey points that the chart did not reflect. The author mentions that the Tonnage generation of "Paper & Paperboard" is trending down since 2005.  While I see a dip in 2005, the area change is barely perceptible and the dots in the line graph look like they trend up (not down) because the overall tonnage generation is going up. Other trends pointed out for Yard Trimmings and Plastics were not obvious in the visualization.  The dots/points make the visual look like a trend line which is more quantity based and not an area graph which is more proportion based. After further review, it appeared that the scaling for Tons reduces the ability to see trends unless they are large differences.  The chart does not represent the points being made by the author. This led to lower usefulness, truthfulness, and perceptibility scores. 

**Intuitiveness**

When I read the entire article, I get the impression the author tried to stick with the same type of charts for consistency sake and not because it was the best representation of the data. The stacked area chart worked well earlier in the article when there were only 4 categories, but it didn't work well with 11 categories. Therefore, intuitiveness in reading a known chart type was average. 

**Intended Audience**

The article indicates the primary audience is going to be municipalities doing research on where they need to focus or change their future recycling programs.  This would make the top generators of waste and trends of the top generators an important aspect of the data.  Students other people doing research relating to recycling and wanting to learn more about National recycling statistics could be a user of this visualization.  This article contains a lot of data and most of the important aspects of the article are data driven but the visuals do not help to highlight the important aspect of the data. 


### Original Redesign Recommendation Ideas

I would change the order of the categories to arranged from largest to highest, simplify the chart by removing the dots/points, and highlight the colors of the chart to the few categories that the author is trying to convey. I would also change the scale of Tonnage to help show the trends that the author is trying to convey. The article mostly references data between 1990-2017, so I would start by removing 1960-1980. That would allow the resizing of the Tons access to show more detailed changes. Most of the critique is removing something for changing the visualization, not adding more data. The data is there, but not put together in a way that helps drive the points made in the article.

## Wireframe Story
I decided to work through the wireframe using pen and paper.  I started by creating one statement that encompasses the story of the data visuals.

>What types of material makes up the total of municipal solid waste generated and how has each material changed over the years. 

Here is the high-level process flow:

I then documented what I expected to see in the data visualizations and created some sketches.  I sketched a new Total MSW Generated by Material, 2017 pie chart with the order arranged descending and highlighting the top 4. I worked on this visualization because it is so closely tied the Generation Tonnages, 1960-2017 visualization so I wanted to sketch the plan for both to review together.  I sketched 2 version so the Generation Tonnages, 1960-2017 visualization, one is a modified stacked area and the other is a trend line chart, which would allow the trends in the data to be more apparent. I then asked two people, one of whom is a possible audience member, for feedback on my sketches below.

### Feedback

*Feedback Person 1: Pie Chart*  
1. Like the pie chart. The % is very easy to see.
2. The colors give a good visual of the pie pieces and division between the pieces. Don't like the grey and the grey isn't very effective.
3. The little pieces are not as important as the colored, big pieces.

*Feedback Person 1: Stacked Area chart*
1. The chart is clear and the grid lines make it easy to read. 
2. I see that the trend is going up.  All the lines go up.  
3. The person thinks that all of the lines are trend lines and does not understand what all the color under the line represents. 
4. After explaining portions of the graph, person indicated they are not familiar with this type of chart and would have thought it represented trend lines. Still does not see any downward trends in the data. 
5. Person saw the trend line graph on the page and said that chart shows the downward and upward trends more clearly and it was more familiar. 

*Feedback Person 2: Pie Chart*  
1. Chart is legible and tell you what you need to know.
2. Metal looks bigger than food.
3. Colors pinpoint the areas that are higher in the value (top 4).
4. Greys are not enough to worry about.

*Feedback Person 2: Stacked Area chart*
1. Trend of generated wasted is increasing (higher)
2. Colors correlate with pie chart, which is good
3. Not familiar with the type of stacked chart but the lines are all trending up so that is good. 
4. After explanation she saw the differences in areas but didnâ€™t see a negative trend. 

## Redesigned Visualizations
After reviewing the feedback, it became clear that while the stacked area chart was good at showing the proportion to total, it was not good at highlighting the trend of a specific material, even with a different scale.  If the intent of the article to it help municipalities make decisions about future recycling programs, it will be important to see what the generated materials are and how they are changing.  The line chart represents this better than the stacked area chart, so I decided to use a line chart.   I also ordered all the materials in descending order and highlighted the top 4 categories in color to give importance and clearly show to the materials generating the most waste.  These are also the materials that the author specifically calls out with more detail in the article.  If the reader is interested in the other materials not highlighted, they are still able to scroll over the grey line to see the trend for that material.  I kept the colors coordinating with the pie chart to ensure proportion was understood. 

The data for my redesign was obtained from the [National Overview: Facts and Figures on Materials, Wastes and Recycling](/https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture) article<sup>1</sup>.

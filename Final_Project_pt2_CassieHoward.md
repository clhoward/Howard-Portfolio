# Final Project - Part II

## Story Arc and Story Board

The basic storyboard helped me determine the flow and what high-level statics I want and need to try tell each part of the story.  I created a Story Arc and a Story board for part 1 to help identify the framework and determined what statistic I would need and what section of the presentation it would go in.  This helped me determine the type of data I would need to go find.

**Mood Board**

I have started searching for the types of images I like that I might want to incorporate into my presentation.  I started a mood board to help me collage the photos to determine if I like them together.  I have also added 2 possible color palettes based off a few of the photos using coolors.com.  I used 2 of the images below in my wireframe to get some feedback relating to how the photos work with the ideas in the presentation.

## Wireframe
  
I created a more detailed wireframe of my story in PowerPoint.  I created real visualizations from the data I have gathered and put them into a flow with 1-2 sentences that I felt helped tell the story.  I used black arrows to identify the flow.

## Feedback

I had 3 different people review my detailed wireframe and provide feedback.  My target audience is anyone who may be in the market to be getting a new car, therefore, this spans multiple age groups.  I thought it was important to get feedback from different genders to see if my visuals impacted them differently.

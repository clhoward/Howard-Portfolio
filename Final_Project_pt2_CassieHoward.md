# Final Project - Part II

## Story Arc and Story Board

The basic storyboard helped me determine the flow and what high-level statics I want and need to try tell each part of the story.  I created a Story Arc and a Story board for part 1 to help identify the framework and determined what statistic I would need and what section of the presentation it would go in.  This helped me determine the type of data I would need to go find.

**Mood Board**

I have started searching for the types of images I like that I might want to incorporate into my presentation.  I started a mood board to help me collage the photos to determine if I like them together.  I have also added 2 possible color palettes based off a few of the photos using coolors.com.  I used 2 of the images below in my wireframe to get some feedback relating to how the photos work with the ideas in the presentation.

## Wireframe
  
I created a more detailed wireframe of my story in PowerPoint.  I created real visualizations from the data I have gathered and put them into a flow with 1-2 sentences that I felt helped tell the story.  I used black arrows to identify the flow.

## Feedback

I had 3 different people review my detailed wireframe and provide feedback.  My target audience is anyone who may be in the market to be getting a new car, therefore, this spans multiple age groups.  I thought it was important to get feedback from different genders to see if my visuals impacted them differently.  

| Question  | 22 yrs old - Female - College Student | 62 yrs old - Female - Professional  | 40 yrs old - Male - Professional|
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------
| What do you think the purpose of the presentation is?  | Electric vehicles are better for the environment. | Want more people to buy electric vehicles to reduce pollution. | Buy an electric car! 
| What do you think the solution is? | Start switching to buying electric vehicles.  | Want more people to buy electric vehicles to reduce pollution. | Buy an electric car! 
| Did any part of the data compel or excite you?  | found it "interesting"  | Had info she didn't know but nothing that excited her.  It was "just a graph". | Driving range has gotten a lot better.
| Did anything surprise you?  | That transportation makes up so much of the CO2 emissions.  That an electric charge will cost 1/2 of what a gas is.  | Nothing surprising but there was info I didn't know. | Didn't know there were 8 models that had range > 200 miles or that it was getting that good.
| Was there anything confusing? | The smaller pie as a part of the larger pie was a little confusing at first but she just looked more closely and it made sense. "Can you really go from Atlanta to Chicago on a single charge?" | Nothing confusing. Then she mentioned that she didn't know what I meant by the annual cost. She thought both cost graphs were related because they are the same type and color. She understood the graph but not sure the point I was making. | I wasn't sure where to go after the range map because I was looking for an arrow, then I figured it out. 
| Is there anything more you would like to see? | "Are they going to start charging for electricity?" She thinks most public charging stations are free right now and when will they start charging. "What is the point of the hot air balloons? Donâ€™t they add to pollution?"  | So how much is an electric car vs a regular car?  Aren't they expensive? How long does it take to charge? | No
| Is there anything you would change? | The transportation bar chart was hard to read because it was too light. Liked the gas can picture. Wasn't sure of the importance of the other data in the pie charts based on the colors used. "Other" was a color instead of grey. Wanted to see some differentiation between problem vs solution in the visuals. | Not much color in the presentation. Problem visuals are easier to read and not as boring as the solution visuals. | Liked the gas can visual. Liked the map to show range, but not sure it is accurate.  

## Changes to Implement
After reviewing the feedback, I have decided to make the following changes to my presentation.
1. I am going to change the color scheme of the data to be more deliberate.  I am going to go with orange/yellow/red color scheme for the visuals relating to pollution and CO2 emissions and I am going to go with blue/green for the solution visuals.  This will allow for a clear line going from problem to solution.  
2. The important area of the pie charts are the largest area, so I am going to remove the other colors to avoid confusion on where to focus the eye.  
3. I am going with the gas can representation of CO2 vs gas since it was received better the circles.
4. I need a new visual for the range.  The circles on the map were intended to show the radius that you can go that far from the center point in any direction.  Unfortunely people mis-intenturpted it to mean that the car could go the diameter of the whole circle and that is not true.  Instead I am going to pick a major city and show the distance of a full charge today of 200 miles and an estimated charge in 2021 of 300 miles.
5. I would like to find a more dynamic visual for one of the cost graphs but I am still looking into it.  I will change the colors of the bars to clearly signal electric (green) vs gas (orange or red).  
6. I am going to add informatiom on estimated times to charge the battery.
7. I am going to add the avg cost of a gas car and show the number of models of electric cars that are within the same range.

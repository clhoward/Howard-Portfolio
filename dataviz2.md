n# General Government Debt
These charts were all created using data that was obtained from the OECD Website and contains the General government debt-to-GDP ratio for countries indicated.  The debt-to-GDP ratio "measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance (OECD 2020)."  

Japan has the highest debt levels in the world (Plecher, H.) and it is reflected in their high debt-to-gdp ratio.  Increases in Japan's debt over the last 12 years is mostly attributed to the global recession in 2008 when the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in the United States.  Japan was not impacted directly by the Lehman Brothers collapse; however, they did experience a larger drop in GDP than the U.S.  One of the reasons for this is that Japan has a heavy reliance on exports and demand from exports from countries that were impacted declined significantly.  This impacted Japan's industry and workers as produce demand was reduced.  Japan has a "lifetime employment system" (SAITO, Jun) which made companies reluctant to reduce the workforce.  Many companies were continuing to employee and pay people during a time they were not producing or selling as much product.  The government stepped in with subsidies, which increased the countries debt significantly (SAITO, Jun).  Japan is still feeling the effect of this debt in their debt-to-gdp ratio in 2018.

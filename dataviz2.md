# General Government Debt
Japan has the highest debt levels in the world and it is reflected in their high debt-to-gdp ratio (Plecher, H.).  The debt-to-GDP ratio "measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP.  It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance (OECD 2020)."  Increases in Japan's debt over the last 12 years is mostly attributed to the global recession in 2008 when the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in the United States.  Many countries felt the direct and indirect impact of this collapse (see *Figure 2*).  While Japan was not directly invested with Lehman Brothers, they experienced a signficant impact to their GPP indirectly. The impact to their dept-to-GDP ratio was larger than the United States, where the collapse had direct impact to investors and the subprime mortgage rates (SAITO, Jun) (see *Figure 3).   

One reason for Japans significant impact was that they had a heavy reliance on exports and demand for exports from other countries that were impacted declined significantly.  The reduced demand impacted Japan's industry and workers as they produced less.  Japan has a "lifetime employment system" (SAITO, Jun), which made companies reluctant to reduce the workforce.  Many companies were continuing to employee and pay people during a time they were not producing or selling product.  The government stepped in with subsidies to keep unemployment low, which increased the countries debt significantly (SAITO, Jun).  *Figure 3* shows the continued increase to Japan's debt-to-gdp ratio over the last 12 yeras.  While many other countries had increases to their debt-to-gdp ration in 2008 and several years beyond, many have bounced back and have started to show decreases in their ratio.  Select a country in *Figure 3* to see if they have started to recover or continue to struggle like Japan.

# Final Project
**Project Name**
Why Your Next Vehicle Should Be an Electric Vehicle

**Project Owner**
Cassie Howard

**Other Stakeholders**  
- Christopher Goranson, Professor of Telling Stories with Data
- Students of Telling Stories with Data who will critique the final presentation

**Project Key Statement** 
Today's redesigned electric vehicles have longer battery life, more charging stations, and reduced carbon emissions making them the best option as your next new vehicle purchase.   

**Project Summary**
My project is indented to persuade the reader into purchasing or supporting electric vehicles.  Change is needed to combat the current issues of climate change and pollution.  Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is the largest pollutant and transportation is a big contributor of CO2.  One way to reduce transportation CO2 is to drive an electric vehicle. When electric vehicles were introduced, there were a lot of issues including short battery life, limited charging stations, and high costs, that made it an impractical option for most people.  Recent technology innovation has virtually eliminated those issues and have made electric vehicles a possibility for anyone. Electric vehicles will reduce pollution, smog, and carbon emissions with costs and options that are comparable to a combustible engine vehicle.  With longer battery life, faster and more charging stations, and significantly reduced carbon emissions, the readers next vehicle purchase should be an electric vehicle.  


## Outline
Below is the outline structure I plan on using for my project. I start the presentation with an introduction as to what the problem is, which in this case is CO2 pollution.  The main section is going to be used to provide one possible solution to this problem, which is the switch from combustable engine cars to electric cars.  The final section will include to action to buy an electric vehicle. 

	1. Introduction
		a. High CO2 levels are causing pollution, smog, and climate change
		b. Vehicle carbon emissions is a leading contributor of CO2 levels
	2. Main 
		a. Electric Vehicles produce less pollution/carbon emissions
		b. Show timeline for major milestones for electric vehicles
		d. Issues that plagued electric vehicles include and how they have improved signficantly over time:
			i. Short battery life - show how this has drastically improved
			ii. Limited infrastructure - show # of charging station increases and projections
			iii. Cost - show how cost has dropped
				1) Electric vs gas costs
				2) battery cost projections
			iv. Options - show current and projected vehicle type options
	3. Conclusion
		a. Call to action: Make your next vehicle an electric vehicle
		b. If you are not in the market for a new vehicle, you can support electric vehicles by...
 
## Intial Sketches
### Story Arc
The story arc helped me determine the flow of how I want the user to feel as I walk through my presentation. It will start by working through the current situation of pollution and climate change. Then I walk through the first electric vehicle, which was a great solution to climate change but had some problems (hump in the arc) and then I will talk about the innovation of the last several years that remediate most of those problems.

### Storyboard
The storyboard helped me determine the flow and what high-level statics I want to try and find to tell each part of the story.  I used the story arc as my framework and determined what statistic I would need and what section of the presentation it would go in.  This helped me determine the type of data I would need to go find.

### Draft Data Visuals
Here is a draft of 

## The Data
I used the draft sketches to help determine what data I would need and then used the data links provided and Google to see what data I can find.  
	1. Data related to CO2 emmissions and composition data is located on the United States Environmental Protection Agency website (www.epa.gov).  I have found composition and source information in both downloadable format or in PDF tables that can be scraped.  I will either use Tableau or Flurish for these visuals.
	2. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (www.nrel.gov) had data relating the National Plug-In Electric Vehicle Infrastructure.  This site has information relating to all of the charging stations available for public use and indicates if they are new fast charging stations. They had this data for 2020 in downloadable form that includes geolocation, which will allow me to a map using Tableau.  My intent is the create two geolocation charts, one from 10-15 years ago and one from today, to show the improvement of volume.  I am still looking for the historical data with geolocation.  If I can't find it, will just use one geolocation chart.  
	4. The Alternative Fuels Data Center, which is part of the US Department of Energy https://afdc.energy.gov/
	3. I found some history of battery cost in an article from BusinessWeek.  It is enough data for a trendline chart to show the drastic decrease over the last several years.  I will continue to search for more data on the NREL and EPA sites.

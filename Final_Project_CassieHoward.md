# Final Project
Project name: Why Your Next Vehicle Should Be Electric
Project owner: Cassie Howard

Other stakeholders & their roles:  
- Christopher Goranson, Professor of Telling Stories with Data
- Students of Telling Stories with Data who will critique the final presentation

Project Key Statement: 
Today's redesigned electric vehicles have longer battery life, more charging stations, and reduced carbon emissions making them the best option as your next new vehicle purchase.   

Project Summary: 
My project is indented to persuade the reader into purchasing or supporting electric vehicles.  Change is needed to combat the current issues of climate change and pollution.  Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is the largest pollutant and transportation is a big contributor of CO2.  One way to reduce transportation CO2 is to drive an electric vehicle. When electric vehicles were introduced, there were a lot of issues including short battery life, limited charging stations, and high costs, that made it an impractical option for most people.  Recent technology innovation has virtually eliminated those issues and have made electric vehicles a possibility for anyone. Electric vehicles will reduce pollution, smog, and carbon emissions with costs and options that are comparable to a combustible engine vehicle.  With longer battery life, faster and more charging stations, and significantly reduced carbon emissions, the readers next vehicle purchase should be an electric vehicle.  


## Outline
Below is the outline structure I plan on using for my project. I start the presentation with an introduction as to what the problem is, which in this case is CO2 pollution.  The main section is going to be used to provide one possible solution to this problem, which is the switch from combustable engine cars to electric cars.  The final section will include to action to buy an electric vehicle. 

	1. Introduction
		a. High CO2 levels are causing pollution, smog, and climate change
		b. Vehicle carbon emissions is a leading contributor of CO2 levels
	2. Main 
		a. Electric Vehicles produce less pollution/carbon emissions
		b. Show timeline for major milestones for electric vehicles
		d. Issues that plagued electric vehicles include and how they have improved signficantly over time:
			i. Short battery life - show how this has drastically improved
			ii. Limited infrastructure - show # of charging station increases and projections
			iii. Cost - show how cost has dropped
				1) Electric vs gas costs
				2) battery cost projections
			iv. Options - show current and projected vehicle type options
	3. Conclusion
		a. Call to action: Make your next vehicle an electric vehicle
		b. If you are not in the market for a new vehicle, you can support electric vehicles by...
 
## Intial Sketches
### Story Arc
The story arc helped me determine at the flow of how I want the user to feel as I walk through my presentation. The will start by working through the current situation of pollution and climate change. Then I walk through the first electric vehicle, which is a great solution to climate change but has some problems, which causes the hump and then talk about the innovation of the last several years that remediate most of the problems.

### Storyboard
The storyboard helped me determine the flow of what high-level statics I want to try and find to tell a part of the story.  I used the story arc as my framework and determined what statistic I would need and what section of the presentation it would go in.  This helped me determine the type of data I would need to go find.

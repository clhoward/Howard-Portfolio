# Final Project
Project name: Why Your Next Vehicle Should Be Electric
Project owner: Cassie Howard

Other stakeholders & their roles:  
- Christopher Goranson, Professor of Telling Stories with Data
- Students of Telling Stories with Data who will critique the final presentation

Project Summary: 
Today's redesigned electric vehicles have longer battery life, more charging stations, and reduce carbon emissions making them the best option as your next new vehicle purchase.  Electric vehicles will reduce pollution, smog, and carbon emissions with costs and options that are comparable to an combustible engine vehicle.  With longer battery life, faster and more charging stations, and signifcantly reduced carbon emissions, your next vehicle purchase should be an electric vehicle.  


## Outline

	1. Introduction:
		a. High CO2 levels are causing pollution, smog, and climate change
		b. Vehicle carbon emissions is a leading contributor of CO2 levels
	2. Main 
		a. Electric Vehicles produce less pollution/carbon emissions
		b. Electric vehicle was introduced in xxx, with several issues.
		c. Show timeline for major milestones for electric vehicles
		d. Issues that plagued electric vehicles include:
			i. Short battery life - show how this has drastically improved
			ii. Limited infrastructure - show # of charging station increases and projections
			iii. Cost - show how cost has dropped
				1) Electric vs gas costs
			iv. Options - show current and projected vehicle type options
	3. Conclusion
 
Make your next vehicle an electric vehicle
